Gridlock (A program to fit grids of data)
Maintainer: Jonathan Williams

DESCRIPTION

Code to fit a grid of data points with a parabola or paraboloid (depending on the number of free parameters) via chisq minimization and find the vertex.  Currently implemented for data with up to 3 free parameters.  Example data is included in the 'sample_1par.txt', 'sample_2par.txt' and 'sample_3par.txt' files.

Data files must contain a line specifying the number of free parameters, formatted 'NUM_PAR n' where n is the number of free parameters.  It is possible to specify grid fitting limits for each parameter in data files, see the 'sample_3par.txt' file for an example.  It is also possible to plot data (using gnuplot) by including a line in the data file specifying a plotting style, see the plotting section below.

FITTING FUNCTIONS USED

Currently, parabola/paraboloid type functions are used.
1 free parameter: f(x) = a1*x^2 + a2*x + a3
2 free parameters: f(x,y) = a1*x^2 + a2*y^2 + a3*x*y + a4*x + a5*y + a6
3 free parameters: f(x,y,z) = a1*x^2 + a2*y^2 + a3*z^2 + a4*x*y + a5*x*z + a6*y*z + a7*x + a8*y + a9*z + a10

PLOTTING

Add these commands (eg. 'PLOT 1d') as a line in the data file to enable plotting:
PLOT 1d - Shows plot(s) in one variable, using fixed values for any other variables corresponding to the closest data points to the vertex of the fit function.
PLOT 2d - Shows plot(s) in two variables (surface plot), using fixed values for any other variables corresponding to the closest data points to the vertex of the fit function.

INSTRUCTIONS

Use 'make' to compile.  Tested using GNU make and gcc.
To run the program from anywhere, move the resulting 'gridlock' executable to any directory under your $PATH environment variable.
Tested and working on Ubuntu 14.04 and Scientific Linux/CentOS 6.  Should work on more or less any Linux distro.
